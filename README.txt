`em' is a minimal Emacs configuration that strives to still be
feature-rich. It includes GUI, navigation, completion, editing, and
buffer-local programming facilities, among others.


1 Configure
===========

  if you want to exercise your elisp-fu, just add whatever `.el' or
  `.elc' files to `etc/'


2 Install
=========

  `make'. The `Makefile' is trivial.
