* em
em is a small, offline emacs config. why? there are working
environments with whitelists on remotes, and i work in an industry in
which this practice is common. the package set is listed in =pkg/=
* installation
em requires emacs28 or newer. just ~make clean && make~
* configuration
presumably, there is other elisp fu you want to do outside of
em. place these elisp files (whether byte-compiled or not) into
=etc/=, and they'll be loaded. assume, here, that there is no
well-defined ordering of the loads. if dependencies exist, enforce
them yourself. keep it simple
